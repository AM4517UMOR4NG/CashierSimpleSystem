So this project is for cashier management, I make 4 classes (CashierSystem, CartItem, Product, Transaction). I only added explanation on CashierSystem Class.
There's a vulnerbility or a lack of the system, however if you can fix that I would like to know it.
You can run the program by fully dowloading and make the classes to be connected one to others classes.
I created a cashier system by printf format, named "OneCashierSystem" that's the only class that you can run independently by only dowloading that one class. 
If you want to see GUI output you can download all of those classes on this repository excep the class named "OneCashierSystem".
Alrigh that's all, I hope this small project can help you.
